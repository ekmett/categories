-- A 'Monoidal' category is a category with an associated biendofunctor that has an identity,
-- which satisfies Mac Lane''s pentagonal and triangular coherence conditions
-- Technically we usually say that category is 'Monoidal', but since
-- most interesting categories in our world have multiple candidate bifunctors that you can
-- use to enrich their structure, we choose here to think of the bifunctor as being
-- monoidal. This lets us reuse the same 'Bifunctor' over different categories without
-- painful newtype wrapping.

-- We choose to talk about the 'Bifunctor' being \"monoidal\" rather than the 'Category', as it is much easier
-- to work with the instances in this fashion than to work with newtypes on '(->)' all over the place in Haskell,
-- since we can usually use type inference to figure out which monoidal category is under consideration.
