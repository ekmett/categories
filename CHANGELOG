0.44.5
------

* Added Monad, Applicative, etc. and monad transformer instances to Control.Monad.Indexed.Cont and Control.Monad.Indexed.State
* Created Control.Monad.Indexed.Trans and Control.Monad.Indexed.Fix
* Added Instances for Kan Extensions

0.50.0
------
* Moved back to type families

0.50.3
------
* Renamed 'Alg' to 'Algebra', renamed AlgH to HAlgebra, etc. 
* Added Di- and Bi- algebras
* Added Janis Voigtlaender's asymptotic free monad improvements and their dual, but noted it just uses the right Kan extension
  of a monad.
* Added Elgot (Co)Algebras

0.50.4
------
* Added the Yoneda lemma as a right Kan extension along the Identity monad
* Added limits and colimits and right and left Kan extensions
* Added adjunction composition and higher order adjunction composition
* Added adjunctions as Kan extensions in Control.Functor.Adjunction
* Lifted more monad instances into right Kan extensions
* Renamed (Co)freeLike to (Co)monad(Co)ideal
* Added a lot of HFunctor instances including much of the MTL.

0.51.2
------
* Fixed support for 6.8

0.51.5
------
* Added CoYoneda to Control.Functor.Yoneda
* Added Lambek's lemma (and its dual) in Control.Morphism.Cata (Control.Morphism.Ana)
* Added a Run(Co)Monad(Co)Free class to encapsulate cataFree (anaFree)
* Generalized dyna-, futu-, histo-, and chrono- morphisms to run over the appropriate kth left- and right- Kan extensions
  of their associated (co)free monads as well as the basic (co)free monad. This may permit asymptotic free monad
  improvement in some recursion schemes.
